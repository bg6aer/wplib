# WPLib
**An MV\* Foundation Library for Building Custom WordPress Sites**

WPLib was built for both agency and internal corporate developers who want their custom-developed WordPress sites to be both robust and easy to maintain as site complexity grows. 

##Status
WPLib is in beta status at version 0.11.5 in master.

We are actively working on it with a goal to develop stable beta versions that can be used in production, and then a 1.0.0 version when we are comfortable that the majority of the API will not need to change.

##Demo Themes
- [Underscores4WPLib](https://github.com/wplib/underscores4wplib) - A port of an [Underscores](http://underscores.me) starter theme that can be used as a starter theme but is intended more to allow for comparison between standard WordPress theming practices and using WPLib best practices instead.
- [LawPress](https://github.com/wplib/lawpress) - A demo theme that will eventually be a full-fledged law firm CMS starter theme.

##History
WPLib is based on at least five (5) generations of code developed over five (5) years and the concepts are now mature enough to release publicly.
