# WPLib
A WordPress Application Foundation Library for Agency and Corporate Developers 


##Status
WPLib is currently in **alpha** phase but is being _actively_ developed with a goal to bring to stable beta as soon as possible.  

The latest bleeding edge development is currently happening in the [`mike` branch](https://github.com/wplib/wplib/tree/mike) and versioned by date to coordinate with the [Underscores4WPLib](https://github.com/wplib/underscores4wplib) and [LawPress](https://github.com/wplib/lawpress) demo theme releases, with _"approved"_ code merged to the [`develop` branch](https://github.com/wplib/wplib/tree/develop).

We will be releasing a versioned beta on the [`master` branch](https://github.com/wplib/wplib/tree/master) as soon as we have working demo themes and a reasonable level of documentation on [wplib.org](http://wplib.org).


##History
WPLib is based on at least 5 generations of code developed over 5 years and the concepts are now mature enough to release publicly.
